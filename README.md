# Module-5-Project---Amazon-Coupons

In this project, I use survey data (collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk) to assess a potential instant digital coupon program. In particular, I focus on "carry out and take away" coupons and attempt to determine what factors, if any, predict when that sort of coupon will be accepted. The full report can be found here:

The primary conclusion of this investigation is quite simple: this sort of coupon is very popular, and that popularity is very widespread. People of all ages, incomes, genders, etc. readily accept this sort of coupon, and it is accepted at high rates regardless of time of day, direction of travel, or the coupon's expiration period. In short, a high rate of acceptance (~74%) is virtually guaranteed for this sort of coupon.

That said, if the goal is to maximize the acceptance rate, the most promising factors to act upon are (1) the time of day when the coupon is sent and (2) the coupon's expiration period. Other factors that could be taken into account include (in order of promise): (3) gender, (4) direction of travel, (5) income, (6) general carry-out behavior, and (7) age.  

More specifically, my recommendations would be:
- To send this sort of coupon primarily in the afternoon/evening (when the acceptance rate is generally >80%).
- To send this sort of coupon primarily with a one-day expiration period - and *always* with a one-day expiration when coupons are sent in the morning hours.

If these two recommendations are followed, the acceptance rate should consistenly be 78% or more.

In addition, it may be worth targeting males and/or people with low to low-middle incomes (roughly $12,500 - $62,500) - I'd recommend further investigation in each case. As for the other observed associations (involving direction of travel, general carry-out behavior, and age), I'm inclined to think that they are either not robust enough and/or the effects are likely to be too small for there to be much value in pursuing them further.
